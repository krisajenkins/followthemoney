Twelve of the 14 cars involved in the accident near Shimonoseki were supercars - including eight Ferraris, two Mercedes and a Lamborghini. The accident caused \u00a32m of scrap metal (Pic: Kyodo News) Reports suggest the crash happened after a Mercedes was driven on the wrong side of the road on the Chugoku expressway. Japanese newspaper The Daily Yomiuri said 10 people were taken to hospital with minor injuries. The group of drivers was reportedly made up of self-employed \"car enthusiasts\", who were travelling from Kyushu to Hiroshima. Pictures of the scene show the motorway littered with debris from the damaged cars. Among the vehicles were two Ferrari F430s, two 360 Modenas, two F355s, a Lamborghini Diablo and a Nissan GTR."

The reactors are said to be intact at the moment. And officials claim there hasn't been a change in the radiation levels since the latest incident took place. At least 22 people have already been exposed to radiation - after an earlier explosion following Friday's devestating tremor and tsunami. Officials say the possibility of another blast is now unlikely. People within a 20km radius of the reactor have been evacuated to safety. There had been warnings of a three-metre high tsunami moving towards the northeast coast of Japan caused by a strong aftershock. We're now getting reports that the alert has been lifted. Prime Minister Naoto Kan has called it the worst crisis since World War II. RT's Ivor Bennett is in Sendai, one of the towns worst-affected by the huge wave."

It was caused by an 8.9-magnitude earthquake that struck 130 kilometres off the eastern coast - sending a reported 10-metre wall of water inland, causing widespread devastation. 32 people are confirmed dead - but that number's expected to rise. The wave has also reached Russia's Kuril islands to the north, reportedly around a metre high. In Japan, 200 people have reportedly been washed away, with several others missing in Japan's Sendai city. Tokyo's been all-but shut down - with fires and injuries widely reported there. Millions are without electricity. Norita International Airport is also closed. 20 powerful aftershocks have been recorded since the first quake, which was the strongest ever recorded in Japan - and the 6th biggest-ever. An earthquake has now been felt in Hawaii - measuring 4.5 - with tsunami waves expected within a few horus."

Buildings, cars and ships were also swept by the raging waters. Several are missing on Japan's Sendai island. The first wave has also reached Russia's Kuril islands to the north, reportedly around a metre high. There are several fires along Japan's eastern coastline, and 4 million homes are without power. The Prime Minister's ordered an emergency response team to tackle the disaster - with aircraft scrambled to the worst-affected area.

But fears remain it'll easily be 10 times that. It all comes amid warnings of new threats in the country. Officials fear there's a risk of another explosion at the Fukoshima power plant but remain confident it can withstand the blast like the first reactor did on Saturday. The government is also saying that a second reactor in Fukushima could be experiencing a partial meltdown. Meanwhile, radiation has increased 400-fold in the region of Miyagi which lies dozens of kilometres further north. It's not clear at the moment if the radiation came from the local nuclear plant or drifted up from the facility in Fukushima following Saturday's explosion. Officials claims the radioactivity released so far does not pose a threat to human health. Having said that, the number of people admitted to hospital suffering exposure is said to be rising amid a series of aftershocks that continue to rock the country. The Japanese Prime Minister has been addressing the situation and he said that 12000 people have been rescued so far. He called it was the hardest time for the country since World War II. Meanwhile the emergency services are on high alert in Russia's Far East."

Since then, residents have left their homes, and the \"no man land\" has been out of touch with the rest of the world. A Japanese journalist, Tetsuo Jimbo, ventured through the evacuation zone last Sunday, and filed the following video report. He says that, inside the evacuation zone, homes,building, roads and bridges, which were torn down by Tsunami, are left completely untouched, and the herd of cattle and pet dogs, left behind by the owners, wonders around the town while the radiation level remains far beyond legal limits.

It comes after a powerful aftershock forced crews to flee the area. On Tuesday Japan raised the nuclear alert around the facility to the maximum level of seven. This puts the crisis on a par with the Chernobyl disaster. The decision was based on new data showing more radiation had leaked from the damaged plant than previously thought. But officials say that the upgrade does not mean the situation has become more critical. Meanwhile, attempts to restore cooling systems at the reactors appear to be no closer to success. Nuclear engineer, Arnold Gundersen, believes the Japanese government has downplayed the extent of the disaster... RT on Facebook: www.facebook.com RT on Twitter: twitter.com"

Military helicopters are currently dropping seawater onto the stricken reactors in the latest bid to avert nuclear meltdown... While other aircraft are monitoring the amount of radiation. If levels get too high for the air crews, trucks with water cannons will be deployed to try and get the temperature of troubled reactors to drop.

On the ground, survivors of the earthquake - measuring seven on the Richter scale - are struggling to save those still trapped under the rubble. At least a third of the population are now homeless - including the country's president. An estimated three million people will need emergency relief as aid organsations make their way to the scene. The Haitian Red Cross predicts an horrific death toll of around 50000 while the World Health Organization predicts the sheer numbers of dead may lead to an outbreak of disease."

Fresh rains in the hardest-hit northwest threatened to overwhelm a major dam and unleash a new deluge. Relief work for some 3.2 million people has been delayed by swamped roads, washed-out bridges and downed communication lines, and survivors have complained about government inaction."

More foreign soldiers and police are being sent to the Island-nation, where looting and violence are on the rise, as people are still desperate for vital supplies - a week after the disaster. The French minister in charge of humanitarian relief, Alain Joyandet, has asked the UN to clarify America's role in Haiti. He says after US troops took charge of the main airport, they've been turning away aircraft carrying aid, in favour of military planes. French President Nicolas Sarkozy's office tried to play down reports of the rift with the US, saying cooperation between the two countries was going well. But the charity Doctors without Borders backed Joyandet's call to the UN, adding that aid delays threaten lives."

Putin, who is currently visiting the Far Eastern region of Kamchatka, joined the team of marine biologists at the Kronotsky Nature Preserve, where the nearly-extinct mammals have recently been observed. Despite the poor weather conditions and the rough water, a motor boat carrying the wetsuit-clad team went to sea in search of gray whales. After a group of whales was detected, the Prime Minister shot a sample-taking dart at one of the animals with a crossbow. \"We tried to work with three or four whales, but we only got one,\" Putin told the press after setting foot on the shore. \"I had a rush: three times I missed, but the fourth time I hit it.\""

The US Geological Survey said Wednesday's quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.1. No damage or injuries were immediately reported and no tsunami warning was issued. Indonesia is evacuating more people from near Mount Merapi after the volcano had its biggest eruption yet. The explosive eruption Wednesday afternoon lasted more than an hour and shot searing ashes kilometers (miles) into the sky. The massive blast endangered places that had not been not evacuated as well as refugee camps within that distance. RT on Facebook: www.facebook.com RT on Twitter: twitter.com"

            "description": "Indonesia's military forced villagers off the slopes of the country's most volatile volcano on Saturday as it unleashed a new powerful explosion that claimed another victim and temporarily shut down an airport. Some 36 people have now died near Mount Merapi since it first erupted last on Tuesday. Plumes of heavy gray ash poured from the crater's mouth as rocks and debris cascaded down its slopes. Saturday's powerful 21-minute eruption briefly forced the closure of the airport in the nearby city of Yogyakarta, 20 km south of the volcano. At least one school was also closed due to the quantity of ash which has fallen on the city. 47000 people who live around Mount Merapi are staying in government camps or with friends and relatives. The latest rumblings of Merapi come as rescuers cope with a rising death toll from a tsunami in another part of the sprawling archipelago nation. The catastrophes struck within 24 hours in different parts of the seismically active country, severely testing Indonesia's emergency response network.

Buildings, cars and ships were also swept by the raging waters. Several are missing on Japan's Sendai island. The first wave has also reached Russia's Kuril islands to the north, reportedly around a metre high. There are several fires along Japan's eastern coastline, and 4 million homes are without power. The Prime Minister's ordered an emergency response team to tackle the disaster - with aircraft scrambled to the worst-affected area.

The company had only expected a tsunami of 5.7 meters at the Daiichi plant and one of 5.2 meters at the Daini. The wave disabled emergency power generators and heat removal pumps at Fukushima Daiichi on 11 March.

The new river crossing started shaking violently and a massive downpour at the same time made conditions worse. Drivers say their cars were literally thrown into the air, many thinking it was an unexpected earthquake. The shaking was so severe it caused vehicles to career into the opposite lane creating chaos. Local authorities claim the shaking of the bridge was possibly caused by an earthquake. Seismologists, however, say this is highly unlikely. Meanwhile, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has ordered an investigation into the bridge's safety and construction history. The bridge across Volga river is 1260 meters long and 32 meters wide. It was opened less than a year ago in October 2009."

According to official data on Sunday, the number of the dead in 12 stricken Japanese prefectures totalled 13802 people and missing 14129. More than 4928 people were wounded. People died mostly in the prefectures of Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate. The search work continues, including inside the evacuation zone around the stricken Fukushima-1 nuclear plant where, according to rescuers, several thousand bodies may remain.

It was caused by an 8.9-magnitude earthquake that struck 130 kilometres off the eastern coast - sending a reported 10-metre wall of water inland, causing widespread devastation. 61 people are confirmed dead - but that number's expected to rise. The wave has also reached Russia's Kuril islands to the north, reportedly around a metre high. In Japan, 200 people have reportedly been washed away, with several others missing in Japan's Sendai city. Tokyo's been all-but shut down - with fires and injuries widely reported there. Millions are without electricity. Norita International Airport is also closed. 20 powerful aftershocks have been recorded since the first quake, which was the strongest ever recorded in Japan - and the 6th biggest-ever. An earthquake has now been felt in Hawaii - measuring 4.5 - with tsunami waves expected within a few hours.

Michel Santos, euronews: Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres welcome to euronews. For the 5th consecutive year there are more than 42 million forcibly displaced people throughout the world.

Since the beginning of 2011, the Ivory Coast, Libya, Yemen, Syria, the Horn of Africa - Somalia - and then more recently Sudan, South Sudan and Mali. And at the same time, old crises never seem to die: Afghanistan is still going on and on; Somalia or the Democratic Republic of Congo. And more than 70 percent of the world's refugees have been refugees for more than 5 years. Michel Santos, euronews: Is the worldwide economic turmoil affecting the aid for refugees? Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, UN High Commissioner for Refugees: The world economic crisis has made two impacts. It's reduced the amount of humanitarian support for people in need but it's also triggered instability and conflict in many situations.

He told us: ''At the Onagawa power plant there was a fire in the engine room where electricity is produced. At two other sites, Fukushima N1 and N2, there was apparently difficulty in cooling the reactors'' ... www.euronews.net"

In Iwaki along the Fukushima coastline hundreds gathered for a moment of silence on the beach. Nearly 80000 across the area have been forced to leave their homes due to radiation fears. Katsuko Ishii and her family are evacuees from the exclusion zone. \"My home is in Namie town, and so we can't go home. There aren't really any words for it. To be honest, we haven't really had any good signs,\" said the 42-year-old mother. Politicians and bureaucrats have come under fire over the past year for their response to the nuclear disaster and reconstruction challenge. The political row has even affected children. 12-year-old Shiori Anzai was overcome with tears as she said: \"I've hardly noticed the year go by, but you really have to wonder what politicians have been doing the whole time.\" In Ofunato hundreds of black-clad residents came to the town hall, and laid white chrysanthemums to remember the 420 people from the town who are still missing. While the country observed a minute's silence to mark the time the earthquake struck a year ago, Ofunato paused again 33 minutes later, the moment the 23-metre tsunami engulfed the town of 41000.

The March 11th 2011 earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors of the region's main nuclear plant into meltdown. In the town of Iwaki, which is heavily dependent on the fishing trade, the subsequent radiation leaks were a huge blow. \"Our spirits are down and we want fishing operations to resume as soon as possible,\" said local fisherman Kinzaburo Shiga. \"Consumer worries about seafood safety is more of a concern than radiation scares. We help out with the monitoring in the hope that one day consumers will return to eat our delicious local fish.\" Officials have tested close to 3000 fish samples over the past year. They're due to announce the results of a contamination test from new born fish on Wednesday. Radiation fears continue to affect those living in Fukushima city too, which is just 50 kilometres from the nuclear plant. While readings have fallen considerably, for many local children, the outdoors is still a no-go area. Instead, Japan's Red Cross has set up a temporary indoor playground in one neighbourhood. \"There are lots of people worried about radiation, especially parents who don't want to let their children play outside,\" said volunteer Takeru Fukawa. \"So we decided to start this sort of indoor play area to allow children to run around and have fun.\" Parents are campaigning to force the Fukushima <b>...</b>"

Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko led a minute of silence in Tokyo's National Theatre at the precise moment that the 9.0 magnitude tremor unleashed a wall of water that ravaged the northeast coast, killing thousands. The country is still grappling with the cost, both human and economic. \"It is important that we do not forget the memories of this big earthquake and pass them onto our descendants, so that readiness for natural disasters is fostered and we can make progress towards building a safer country,\" said the Emperor. As well as dealing with the emotional aftermath of the the disaster, Japan is still in the grips of the nuclear fallout from the crippled Fukushima plant. Residents from a nearby town, abandoned afterwards, returned home for a few hours to pay their respects to those lost 12 months ago. Tens of thousands of people evacuated from the area may never be allowed back to their homes. TEPCO the operator, much criticised for its failure to prepare for the disaster, has issued a fresh apology, vowing to work to solve its problems with safety as first priority.

It's a real problem, especially as we have an ageing population in Japan,\" he said. The search for missing people continues in the fishing hamlet of Rikuzentakata, about 400 kilometres northeast of Tokyo; 2000 people disappeared after the tsunami destroyed the downtown area. \"We're doing our best to find the bodies and, as far as possible, return them to their loved ones and families, but unfortunately the bodies are getting harder to find now,\" said police officer Daichi Kousakau Yoshida.

Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko led a minute of silence in Tokyo's National Theatre at the precise moment that the 9.0 magnitude tremor unleashed a wall of water that ravaged the northeast coast, killing thousands. Across the country memorial services are being held. Japan is still dealing with the emotional fallout from the disaster, as well as the economic and nuclear aftermath. Residents from the abandoned town of Okuma returned home for a few hours to pay their respects to those lost 12 months ago. It's the location of four of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant's reactors. Radiation means the area remains uninhabitable. Tens of thousands were made homeless after a 20 kilometre exclusion zone was set up around the plant. The impact of the nuclear crisis spread far beyond. The disaster exposed serious flaws in safety standards and regulations. Once again the terrible images of the ocean invading the land are prominent in people's minds, as Japan slowly recovers from the tragedy that left some 19000 dead or missing.

It was enormous.\" Another woman added: \"I've never felt such a huge quake.\" ... www.euronews.net"

Three of the 11 towns that registered high levels of radiation after the subsequent meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear power plant have had their entry bans relaxed. The plant was shut down and a 20 kilometre radius exclusion zone was set up forcing nearly 80000 people to leave their homes. But despite roadblocks being lifted, many residents are not expected to return permanently just yet. Schools and other local amenities will remain shut as radiation levels continue to be monitored. Last March's Fukushima incident was the worst nuclear crisis since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Last December, officials said that the plant was now in \"cold shutdown\", a more stable, manageable state. But more than 12 months on, the public is still sceptical about its safety.

Quarterly operating profit was the equivalent of almost 3.7 billion euros after it took back the title of number one in worldwide sales earlier this year. The company also raised its global sales target for this year. Toyota's Senior Managing Officer, Takhiko Ijichi said: \"We plan to continue to increase our earnings and no matter what, we will make sure that we reach this goal and are profitable by next March.\" Strong demand continues for cars like the Camry and Prius in key markets such as the United States and Japan. Toyota's better-than-expected performance contrasted with its closest Japanese rivals Honda and Nissan, but analysts said it faces challenges from the strong yen because it makes so many of its cars in Japan. Even after raising its global output target, Toyota still manufactures nearly 40 percent of its vehicles in Japan, compared with about 25 percent for Nissan and Honda. Despite its rebound, Toyota executives said the company was determined to manage its growth more carefully than it had in the boom years before 2008. Executives have said Toyota lost its focus on quality and came to underestimate the company's reliance on a weak yen in pursuing growth. \"Unless we operate based on a solid recognition that growing our business means new risks, we are at risk of going down the same path as before,\" Ijichi told reporters.

            "description": "www.euronews.net The Japanese government said on Friday that the country's stricken Fukushima nuclear plant has reached 'cold shutdown', meaning that its reactors have stayed below boiling point for some time. The plant was wrecked by an earthquake and tsunami on March 11 that crippled its cooling systems as well as triggering meltdowns and radiation leaks. Ministers then evacuated some 80000 residents within a 20-kilometre radius of the plant."

In addition spending by private individuals is holding firm, on improving consumer confidence. \"The economy is still picking up slowly, while difficulties continue to prevail due to the earthquake,\" the Cabinet Office said in the monthly report. Progress has been frustratingly slow in rebuilding areas of the northeast coast devastated by last year's massive earthquake and tsunami. But there are signs of recovery in the area and the broader economy, albeit uneven. \"Domestic demand is on an upward trend ... if both domestic and external factors improve, along with the nation's policy steps such as public spending related to reconstruction and subsidies for fuel-efficient cars, we expect a pickup in the economy will become certain,\" said Minoru Masujima, director of macroeconomic analysis at the Cabinet Office. However, the report also noted several risks facing the economy, including rising oil prices, Europe's prolonged debt crisis and constraints on power supply with all but two of Japan's 54 nuclear reactors shut amid public safety fears after the radiation crisis sparked by the disaster.

In the biggest claim of its kind in Japan, they are asking for the equivalent of 51 billion euros in compensation. In the law suit, 27 current and former Tepco directors are accused of failing to prepare for a severe accident and ignoring multiple warnings of a possible tsunami. The 42 shareholders want the executives to pay damages to Tepco, which would then use the money to compensate those affected by the disaster. Hiroyuki Kawai, a lawyer representing the shareholders said: \"By seeking to hold individuals responsible, we want to correct the collective and systemic irresponsibility in the nuclear industry.\" There is deep public anger over Tepco's handling of the crisis and the perceived arrogance of top management, including underplaying the seriousness of the disaster in its early stages and delays in compensating those forced to leave their homes. The Fukushima Daiichi plant was wrecked by an earthquake and tsunami last March, triggering the world's worst nuclear crisis in a quarter of a century.

But after the quake the housing problem turned into a crisis, with nearly half of the homes in the capital suffering significant damage. The International Organization of Migration (IOM) says that the number of homeless is down from a peak of around 1.5 million to 400000, which is a significant drop. So why are Haitians still angry? President Michel Martelly, along with the IOM, launched a housing program giving camp residents $500 in rental subsidies for a year."

The string of disasters in Japan has grabbed headlines across the globe but when you are dealing with a story of this magnitude, it is always difficult to accurately convey the reality in a single headline, by-line or bulletin. The dominant narrative in this case has been the threat of Japan's damaged nuclear reactors leaking radiation. No matter how hard the experts try to pull the Chernobyl/Three Mile Island/nuclear buzzwords out of the headlines, they keep finding their way back in.

As the nation marks its one-year anniversary of the devastating earthquake that left more than 230000 people dead, many Haitians are fighting to break the negative stereotypes. On Tuesday's Riz Khan, we speak with renowned Haitian artist Edouard Duval-Carri\u00e9; and Huguens Jean, whose directorial debut Lif Up follows his journey back to Haiti two months after the earthquake. Dr Laurent Dubois, a historian and the co-director of the Haiti Lab at Duke University also joins the programme."

Hundreds of thousands of people are still homeless, more than half a million households do not have water, and workers are still battling to gain control of the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Fears of contaminated food are spreading overseas as officials report traces of radiation in milk products, seawater and 11 kinds of locally-grown vegetables. How will Japan recover from the disaster? Will it be able to regain the world's confidence, and how long will it take?"

Tantawi had been in the post for more than 20 years. So, is it the beginning of a transition to civilian rule in Egypt? Or is it just the Muslim Brotherhood tightening its grip on the country?

            "description": "Did you donate any money to Haiti after the earthquake? Have you donated money to Pakistan to help victims of the floods there? A lot of people can answer yes to the first question, but not so many to the second. What was it about these floods that stopped people dipping into their pockets? We have seen wide shots of saturated fields, families trapped on crudely fashioned lifeboats, villagers left homeless, starving and without clean drinking water. But even with all this we have not been nearly as charitable as we were after the earthquake in Haiti. On The Listening Post this week, we ask: What is about the images of this disaster that fail to evoke the same compassion that others have done? Was it the way the media told the story or are there more complex, perhaps darker reasons behind it?"

In the wake of this current disaster, that dependence is - initially - going to deepen. But as relief efforts slowly turn to plans for reconstruction, it is important to look back at the policies that brought Haiti to the brink in the first place, and the people who had their own vision of self-sufficiency all along. Avi Lewis talks about the US role in the development of Haiti with PJ Crowley, the spokesman at the US state department, and Emira Woods, the co-director of Foreign Policy In Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies and an expert on US foreign policy."

            "description": "Fifty years ago Germany made an international call for help, post-war industry was booming and the country desperately needed manpower. The year 1961 saw an influx of Turkish migrant workers and much to German surprise, many Turks settled - creating its largest minority group. The German media has not exactly been kind to the Turks, in fact, negative stereotyping across all media platforms might well be said to have hindered integration. Post 9/11, Turkophobia in the German media has grown worse. Mohammed Atta, one of the organisers behind the attacks, had worked out of Hamburg, and people began to blur the distinction between the Egyptian ringleader of 9/11 and the Turkish population. \"They are seen as alien, dangerous sometimes, and since 9/11 the religion of these people has become more and more important in the media representation,\" says Mehmet Ata, a journalist at Cologne Express. The story was back in the headlines this time last year when a German politician published a damming account of the negative influence Turks are having on German society. Thilo Sarrazin, his book and its sentiments got a lot of play in the German media, making its impartiality all too evident. The Listening Post's Flo Phillips takes a look at stereotyping and discrimination and the German media's depiction of the country's largest minority group."

            "description": "Somalia has one of the most vibrant media landscapes in the Horn of Africa. There are hundreds of radio, TV and print outlets satisfying the Somali thirst for news. And yet, broadcasters and journalists operate in an atmosphere which is hostile to free expression. Somalia ranks as Africa's most dangerous place to be a journalist - this year alone six reporters have been murdered. The threats to the media in Somalia come from all sides - there are powerful politicians in power battles with each other, there is the notorious armed group al-Shabab and even wealthy businessmen can mean danger. Trying to report on the country's various issues has proven difficult for journalists. Those that do, do so at their peril. But that fragile media environment has not stemmed the growth of the media sector or discouraged young journalists from entering the field. In this week's feature, Listening Post's Flo Phillips explores the media landscape in Somalia, a country where being a journalist can cost you your life."

In the wake of this current disaster, that dependence is - initially - going to deepen. But as relief efforts slowly turn to plans for reconstruction, it is important to look back at the policies that brought Haiti to the brink in the first place, and the people who had their own vision of self-sufficiency all along. Avi Lewis talks about the US role in the development of Haiti with PJ Crowley, the spokesman at the US state department, and Emira Woods, the co-director of Foreign Policy In Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies and an expert on US foreign policy."

As the war rages on in Afghanistan, the decision will leave one of the world's largest refugee populations with nowhere to go following the December deadline. Al Jazeera's Jennifer Glasse speaks to Dan Tyler of the Norwegian refugee council about the the logistical challenges a large-scale return of nearly three million refugees will place on both sides of the border. In particular, Tyler says the undocumented Afghans currently living in Pakistan, estimated to number up to one million, will face especially grueling challenges once they are forced to return to Afghanistan. Tyler, speaking to Al Jazeera from Kabul, says many of those forced to repatriate in the Central Asian nation will become \"de-facto internally displaced people upon arrival in Afghanistan\"."

For decades, the United Nations' World Food Programme (WFP) has been working in the country, trying to improve food production. But despite its best efforts, hundreds of thousands of Haitians continue to rely on food handouts. As Teresa Bo reports from Gonaives in Haiti, last year's devastating hurricane season has only made matters there worse."

Many have headed south, to Brazil, which has been looking for more and more cheap labour. Brazil's justice ministry says that 4000 Haitians have entered the country since January 2010. Now, Brazil is changing its laws and Haitians will have a harder time entering the country. Brazilian officials say they won't expel Haitians already in the country, but that new arrivals will be deported. Al Jazeera's Gabriel Elizondo reports from Brasilia."

Waters from the Indus river surged into the town on Sunday after breaching a levee. Most of the 250000 residents fled before the floodwaters submerged the town. Meanwhile, Pakistani troops have been battling for several days to save the nearby historic city of Thatta, where at least 300000 people have already evacuated. The UN and its partners are providing assistance to millions of flood victims, but so far they've only managed to raise two thirds (pledged and delivered) of the 460 million dollars needed for the relief effort. And as Imtiaz Tyab reports, the lack of aid on the ground is taking its toll."

They were arrested for trying to bring 33 children they believed were orphans out of the earthquake-hit country. The children, whose ages ranged from 2 months to 12 years, are now staying in a temporary home. Haitian officials have given warning that child traffickers could take advantage of the chaos after the quake.

And millions of dollars in foreign investments are also flowing into the country to help it rebuild and shape its future. However, many Haitians see the expansion of foreign companies as a way to take advantage of the widespread poverty plaguing the country, where the unemployment rate is up to 80 per cent. The exploitation concerns come as former US presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush prepare to visit the Caribbean nation on Monday to discuss long-term recovery efforts with Haitian officials. And a part of their plans will be to discuss the expansion of clothing industries in the country - in which workers earn less than $4 a day - one of the lowest wages in the world.

But Al Jazeera's Mohamed Adow, reports that some experts now believe the self-declared republic is at crisis point, as an election row deepens. The current tension in Somaliland centres on the presidential election, which was due to have been held on September 27. The polls have been postponed indefinitely due to serious differences between the political parties since 2008. This uncertainty has led to increased concern about Somaliland in the international community, and a flare-up of political animosity within the territory. Recent violence, particularly in the capital Hargeysa, has shown that the crisis in Somaliland has changed from being political to one of security and stability. Fears over the crisis has even led one senior political figure to warn that it could become another failed state, like neighbouring Somalia. Somaliland is a former British protectorate in north western Somalia. In 1960, it gained its independence and united with what was then Italian Somaliland to form the Somalia republic.

All 54 reactors have been temporarily shut down for safety checks, but are subject to public approval before they are restarted. In Tokyo, hundreds of people have rallied to demand that all of the plants remain permanently closed. They say that last year's Fukushima nuclear meltdown, which came after the country was hit by a devastating earthquake and tsunami, showed that the risks are simply too high. Before the disaster, nuclear power supplied a third of Japan's electricity. Al Jazeera's Mike Firn, reporting from a nuclear plant at Oi, takes a closer look at the debate on nuclear power."

Authorities have told more than a million Haitians to leave flimsy tent camps, where they have been sheltering since January's earthquake. The strengthening storm was expected to drench the island on Friday, which would most likely worsen a deadly cholera outbreak in the country. Jean-Max Bellerive, Haiti's prime minister, has told Al Jazeera that the government is doing all it can to provide aid and better shelter to the most vulnerable, but said it simply does not have the resources to help all of them.

The UN has never accepted responsibility for the cholera epidemic, even though its own investigation found the outbreak stemmed from contamination in a river,right next to its own base, which was not disposing of sewage properly. The investigation found that Haiti's lack of effective water treatment facilities, made worse by a devastating earthquake, led to the rapid spread of the disease, which has killed about 7000 people in the country.

But medical assistance and other kinds of aid have yet to reach many of those who escaped the ruins of Tuesday's catastrophe. The setbacks have made survivors increasingly desperate and angry as bottlenecks and infrastructure damage delay relief efforts. Al Jazeera's Teresa Bo reports from the capital Port-au-Prince where people are trying to make the best out of what little they have to survive. Jan 15, 2010"

Nonetheless - much needed aid has failed to reach thousands of people. To solve the problem, the United Nations has been holding meetings between more than 300 relief groups in the country - aimed at improving delivery co-ordination efforts. And yet the UN's top relief co-ordinator has recently criticised his team in Haiti, saying it has been \"disorganised and inefficient.\" Al Jazeera's Steve Chao reports from Port-au-Prince, where six weeks after the disaster, many Haitians say food and medical assistance are still in short supply.

It has been estimated if a magnitude seven earthquake struck directly beneath the capital today, at least 390000 homes would be destroyed. The government says it is aiming to lower that number drastically in the next ten years.

More than half of Somalia's entire population faces a severe food shortage, and the world body has now officially extended the famine zone. In Mogadishu, there are now half a million refugees and there are warnings from the UN that the famine could spread to the entire south of the country by the end of the year. The UN says it needs at least $1bn, but one leading charity says the public is being mislead into believing that money can solve the crisis. Medicine Sans Frontiere, Doctors Without Borders, wants international aid agencies to admit that reaching some of the worst affected victims of famine may not be possible. The French-based charity has criticised aid agencies and parts of the media for glossing over the realities of the situation. The World Food Programme, which is providing most of Somalia's food, says lives can be saved, but admits there are millions of people it cannot reach.

Rebuilding Haiti will mean returning people to their full mental function as well as providing physical necessities. The challenge goes beyond providing basic supplies and rebuilding - helping Haiti's people to move toward psychological and emotional recovery.

With the news that seawater around Fukushima contains high levels of radioactive iodine, sushi is also off the menu for some. Contamination levels are increasing, and although they are not yet considered dangerous, the international market is beginning to react. China and Taiwan have announced extra tests on Japanese food imports, while the US has banned the import of produce from the affected zone. Al Jazeera's Andrew Thomas reports from Tanohata, Japan."

The UN says close to three million people in Somalia need emergency aid. Al-Shabab, which is said to be connected to al-Qaida networks in Africa and the Gulf, controls the majority of Somalia, including almost half of the capital, Mogadishu. In the past, they have said food aid creates dependency, but they have also used aid for themselves and charged foreign organisations high fees to operate. Al Jazeera's Mariana Sanchez reports."

Jamaat-ud-Dawa has been accused of being a front group for Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is believed to be behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The charity group is also seen as promoting a strict interpretation of Islam, which is at odds with the secular government of Pakistan.

            "description": "Tribal conflicts, cattle theft and border disputes have plagued parts of northern Kenya for years, but a record drought across East Africa has exacerbated existing tensions between tribes in the region. The number of deadly clashes over property, scarce livestock and crop fields has escalated significantly among tribes in Kenya's northern rural region of Turkana and others from bordering countries, including Ethiopia and Sudan. Civilian villagers in Turkana have armed themselves with rifles as they carry out everyday tasks, in a bid to protect their families and property. Al Jazeera's Catherine Soi reports from Turkana on how rampant theft and killings have forced many civilians to resort to desperate measures to ensure their security."

One of only four communities in Japan that have continued to hunt and eat whales in defiance of international opposition, the town was already down to a single operating company, Ayukawa Whaling. The March 11 tsunami that slammed into Japan's northeast coast took most of Ayukawa with it, destroying 80 per cent of houses and leaving 400 of its 1400 residents unaccounted for. The wave shattered Ayukawa Whaling's storage facility and carried its fleet of three whaling ships hundreds of metres inland where they now lie grounded and impotent.

Mizuno - who is also the chairman of the Mizuno sports corporation - said that an Olympic bid could be the catalyst for reconstruction in Japan, which is expected to cost as much as $300 billion. For a full interview with Mizuno - whose further role is as IOC member for Sport and the Environment - watch Counting the Cost on Al Jazeera English on Friday May 6, and later online."

            "description": "Aid agencies are pressing ahead with help for drought hit victims in the Horn of Africa. But that is becoming harder with Al-Shabab rebels in Somalia now saying that a ban on foreign aid remains in place. In a transit refugee camp in Dolo Ado, Al Jazeera's Peter Greste reports that some of the newest arrivals in the camp say that Al-Shabab appears to be stopping people from actually trying to cross the border. \"We cannot verify that ofcourse but certainly the...stories we are hearing is that there simply is no food out there; that the security situation is deteriorating, there is a lot of fighting going on; that people simply have no choice but to move if they possibly can,\" he said. Greste says 1500 people are arriving in Dadaab daily, while 200-500 people are arriving in Dolo Ado from the initial 2000 people. The rebel group has also accused the UN of exaggerating the drought, calling it propaganda. But charities say it is the group's blockade of aid since 2009 that has caused a famine in areas under its control."

Many come to Dadaab, the largest refugee camp in the world, where around 1400 people are arriving each week. Dadaab was built to house 90000 people; it's now home to more than 350000. Many children suffering from malnourishment are reported to have died on the long trek to the camp or within a day of arriving. Behind the crisis lies a devastating mix of civil war, rising food prices and one of the worst droughts to hit the Horn of Africa in modern history.

Officials have evacuated thousands of people this week amid fears a potential burst could affect about 50000 people downstream and sever a road serving as an important trade link with China. Over the past few months many villages have been swallowed in the reservoir and stranded people have had to use boats to travel on the icy waters. Officials hope for a gradual erosion of the blockage once the water starts flowing sometime next week through a canal that army engineers created to drain the lake. But they have not ruled out a sudden breach that could lead to massive flooding. Many residents have complained that the government's help came too late. Al Jazeera's Kamal Hyder reports.

            "description": "The African Union (AU) will hold a donor conference on August 9, with the help of the UN, to raise money for the millions affected by drought in the Horn of Africa. The UN said on Monday thay they urgently need another $1.4bn to save lives. Tens of thousands of Somalis have already died from starvation. However, Al Jazeera's Peter Greste, reporting from Nairobi, says the AU action, while still much needed, is late and is not expected to have a huge impact. Greste says that rain which has begun to fall along a small coastal strip of Somalia may be an indicator that the region's weather patterns are returning to normal. The rains are however not expected to have an immediate effect on food security, he says."

Separately, the UN has declared that three new regions in Somalia are famine zones, making a total of five regions affected by famine thus far in the Horn of Africa country. The UN had said last month two regions were suffering from famine. The United Nations first declared famine in the Bakool and Lower Shabelle regions two weeks ago. The UN is warning that more than three million Somalis, that is about half the population, needs immediate help. Now acute malnutrition and death rates are accelerating in several districts of Middle Shabelle. Al Jazeera identifies the most recent areas affected by the famine."

Dorothy Parvaz left Doha, Qatar, for Syria on Friday to help cover events currently taking place in the country. However, there has been no contact with the 39-year-old since she disembarked from a Qatar Airways flight in Damascus. Parvaz is an American, Canadian and Iranian citizen. Ali Akbar Salehi, the Iranian foreign minister, told Al Jazeera that Iran demands the Syrians to look into the case. \"I hope that it is not true, but if that is the case, then we demand the government of Syria to look into this,\" Salehi said, while on official visit to Doha. Parvaz joined Al Jazeera in 2010 and recently reported on the Japanese earthquake and tsunami for the network."

Mild malnutrition is highly prevalent in Yemen and does not require hospitalization,\" he said. \"A case of severe malnutrition is like the one you just saw, of the one-and-a-half year old who weighs just 4.5 kilograms,\" he said.

While some have sought rescue at camps in Mogadishu, they are still vulnerable to disease and malnutrition. Mohammed Moalim lost all five of his children to malnutrition and disease at one of the feeding camps , as he couldn't afford the funds for medicine. UNICEF estimates that 640000 children are suffering from severe malnutrition across the country. Meanwhile the worst drought Somalia has been experiencing in decades has taken a toll on livestock and sub sequentially, food price. In the town of Dhobely, which borders Kenya, buildings bear the scars of gun battles between troops and islamist militants. Aside conflict and drought, aid has been rejected by the rebels when they were in control of certain regions of the country, leaving 3.6 million Somalis on the edge of starvation. Currently, while humanitarian agencies have been shipping emergency food and makeshift shelters, the Food and Agricultural Organization have appealed for roughly 70 million US dollars to strengthen Somalia's impoverished food sources. \"We are in the middle of a dry period and you can see around that it is completely dry and people have exhausted their stocks. So that means either we intervene with both food and other activities bringing cash into the communities -- or they will continue to die.

The famine and draught currently afflicting the Horn of Africa has killed thousands of people in eastern Africa alone. The Pan African Parliament plans to send a fact-finding committee to refugee camps in eastern Africa in an attempt to get a better understanding of the food crisis in the region. A number of international aid groups have already set up feeding centers and stationed aid workers in the famine-stricken Somalia but they continue to face challenges in gaining access to the areas mired in conflict. In the past few years, the international community has been trying to find ways to address the food-crises in war-torn Somalia, which has been drastically affected by years of conflict, drought and famine. Children are the most vulnerable. \"We have seen an increase in patients. We even have patients coming from the most severe drought-stricken areas in the southern parts of Somalia... We make sure the children start drinking this special milk, that they receive in the beginning, until they can start taking plum peanut, or the peanut paste which is the special nutritional paste and then we slowly turn them on to eating normal food,\" said Medicines Sans Frontieres .

The Shebab insurgents have welcomed the efforts of the international community, after they ousted foreign relief organizations two years ago, accusing them of spying and trying to Christianize the region. \"The rest of southern Somalia is close to famine condition and is likely the conditions will deteriorate further in the next month.\" The two affected regions have witnessed a displacement to the capital Mogadishu and the countries of Ethiopia and Kenya, which has reached 166 thousand displaced people.

On Monday, President Obama announced that in light of the current crisis, we are making available an additional 105 million dollars in emergency funding. Today I'm announcing another 17 million on top of that, with 12 million designed specifically for helping the people of Somalia. That brings the total US humanitarian assistance to the region to more than 580 million dollars this year. We are reaching more than 4.6 million people with this aid.\" Ms. Clinton said. Ms. Clinton re-issued her demand for Al Shabaab militants to give aid workers free entry into Somalia. \"Still, a great deal depends on whether al Shabaab is willing to let international assistance be delivered. And so I once again urge al Shabaab to heed the calls not only of the international community, including the Arab league, but of the cries of their own people, and allow the secure delivery of relief to all those who are afflicted.

In the camps of Mogadishu, displaced children have been provided with counseling and psychological support in a bid to help them overcome stress caused by the trauma they have endured. Children currently live in temporary shelters with limited resources of food, water and sanitation. The camps provide a source of solace for the children who have escaped famine, drought and conflict while some have watched family members die. Hundreds of thousands of families have been forced out of their homes into Somalia's besieged capital Mogadishu and other areas due to the drought and ongoing violence across the war-torn country. Charities and government agencies continue to prioritize working in camps which provide food and clothing as well as better security. There are also child experts who are solely working on rehabilitating thousands of displaced children. Tents just for children have been erected by the United Nations children's fund UNICEF where they can meet other children and participate in activities for them. Trained psychologists and social workers monitor those who have experienced serious trauma. A UNICEF representative, Said Ahmed, says nearly all of the children that come to this tent need help of some kind. \"Before I came here it was really difficult, and I had a lot of problems,\" said Sadiq Abdi Aden. \"But since I came here and I have been very happy - and I get to <b>...</b>"

This region is the sixth in Somalia to be impacted by starvation since the United Nation's first announced the outbreak of famine in July which has affected a little over half the population. On Monday, the UN said that the six out of eight regions south of the country are now affected by the famine, as 750, 000 Somalis are at risk of starvation. Amina Mohammed is an example of a person who has been displaced within Somalia. \"I came from Bay in Southern Somalia last month because of the drought, I settled at Galkayo but the recent clashes scared me and I had to move from there. I got here yesterday but the situation looks the same from where I came from, I don't know what to do,\" she said. Moreover, aid agencies are facing difficulty supplying the people with food, as the al-Qaeda affiliated al-Shabab rebels are prohibiting incoming aid to the southern territory which they predominantly control. Also, displaced farmers don't have enough time to reach their farms to tend their crops by October, when brief rainfall is expected. \"The situation at Bay was very bad, there is a lot of starvation there and there is no water. The last time it rained there was years ago and all our livestock was wiped out. We are farmers and all our crops died, I don't think enough attention is being given to this situation <b>...</b>"

Al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militants imposed a ban on food aid in 2010, which the UN and Washington say has worsened the condition. The UN World Food Programme was among several groups forced out of rebel areas which are now preparing to return, describing the situation in Somalia as increasingly desperate, in a news conference in Geneva on July 22nd. WFP spokesperson Emilia Casella said,\"The situation is extremely dire. We're convinced that it is a lifesaving mission that we are obligated to undertake and therefore as soon as we receive the assurances that we will have security and the proper conditions of access we will be going back, and in fact we're already making those plans together with our partners.\" Al Shabaab had promised to allow relief agencies with \"no hidden agendas\" greater access to their lands. The UN told reporters said it had a \"moral imperative\" to get back into the areas from which it had been forced out. Melissa Fleming, UN commission for refugees chief spokesperson said, \"We are really trying our best to work inside Somalia so that people don't have to make this devastating, life threatening trek into Kenya and Ethiopia.

Socotra is a an archipelago of four islands situated in the Indian Ocean, 240 kms east of Somalia, and 380 kms south of the Arabian peninsula. It was enlisted as a UNESCO world heritage site in 2008. Its remoteness from the mainland has led Socotra Island to be described as the most alien-looking place on earth, as a third of its flora hasn't been discovered anywhere else. A combination of long geographical isolation, around 18 million years, along with heat and drought has contributed to the creation of widespread flora exclusive to Socotra Island. The fictional sounding Dragon's blood tree is one of the Island's most outstanding plants. The red sap of the umbrella-shaped tree was believed to be ancient dragon blood, hence its name. Once used for medicinal purposes and dye, the sap is now used in paint and polish. Centuries ago, the island's ubiquitous aloe plants were also used for its medicinal and cosmetic qualities. Socotra Island also claims the rare Socotran pomegranate tree as one of many plant species found on the island. Contrary to its flora, fauna is minimal, with the bat as the only native mammal to the island. The population of Socotra estimates at 50000, and are of Arab, Somali and South Asian origins, and speak the unique Soqotri language, which is only found elsewhere in minorities of UAE and other Gulf countries.

Security Council resolution 2010 raised the number of troops for the African Union Mission in Somalia from about 9300 to 12000. It also extended its mandate in Somalia until next year. The council has also called on Somalia's transitional government to carry out a roadmap leading to elections within a year. The new troops will likely come from Burundi, Djibouti, Sierra Leone and Uganda. Somalia's Ambassador to the United Nations, Elmi Ahmed Duale, said peacekeepers were urgently needed across his country. Elmi Ahmed Duale said, \"Mr. President, as most of the members of the Security Council are aware of, the Somali security forces are overextended at present and they are contained only in Mogadishu and that it is of utmost urgency to enlarge and improve the capabilities of the Somali armed forces and police. Furthermore, as also stated by His Excellency, the Secretary-General, in order to consolidate and build on the recent security gains, it is essential to also enlarge the AMISOM forces. There has been positive reference to this in this resolution.\" In addition to security issues, Somalia is currently in the throes of a devastating drought and famine.

Bulent Yildirim said, \"We will dispatch another ship loaded with four tonnes of humanitarian aid this week. During the campaign we are aiming to send aid worth 50 billion Turkish Liras (28 billion USD) to Somalia.\" 3.7 million Somalis are suffering from severe famine after drought affected some 11.6 million people across Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. The Turkish government has already dispatched two cargo planes loaded with 50 tons of food and medical supplies earlier this week and the Turkish Red Crescent is working with the government's development agency and Office of Religious Affairs to raise donations from the public. Turkish officials were carrying out preparations for a meeting of the 57-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference on August 17, 2011 in Istanbul. The drought, the worst in decades, has affected about 12 million people across the Horn of Africa. Famine conditions were expected to persist until the end of the year as drought, conflict and a lack of food aid have left 3.6 million people at risk of starvation in southern Somalia.

Guterres expressed his annual solidarity to a community during an important time that relates to their religious beliefs. This year, he picked Somalia and scheduled a visit that coincided with the end of the holy month of Ramadan - Eid. While this is a celebratory occasion for Muslims, Somalis have been suffering from the severe drought and starvation. \"The international communities need to get together. All actors -- UN, Red Cross, Red Crescent, NGOS, Islamic organizations, need to work in a combined way, in a coordinated way, to be able to address the needs of these people that are suffering so much,\" said Guterres. According to Guterres, there are currently 850000 refugees outside Somalia, and 1.4 million displaced inside Somalia, which he says is more difficult to support. \"The Eid is a good moment to make this appeal, after Ramadan, to all parties to the conflict, to respect the humanitarian law, and to let humanitarian aid reach the totality of the territory of Somalia,\" he said. Relief aid agencies are finding it difficult to reach certain areas with millions of people who require aid. Many areas are under the control of Al Shabaab rebels, an al Qaeda-affiliated group.

Most of Mogadishu's residents have been displaced by war, and thousands of southern inhabitants were forced to relocate to the capital to escape the tough drought that hit their areas and killed their cattle. They hoped to find in the capital some respite from starvation. Nuria Moallem is just one of the people who recently fled from southern Somalia because of the famine. Two of her children died from starvation a few days ago and has nothing to cheer about during the holiday, especially as she is barely able to feed her remaining children. \"We live in very hard conditions and I cannot feel the joy of this Eid. I look forward to getting the basics necessities at home\" she said. This woman and many other families in this camp, are up against their greatest challenges. Their lives depend on aid through charity. As they celebrate Eid amidst this scenario they are hopeful that the next holiday will bring their families some happiness. Despite the odds, relief agencies are still trying to help families in need. In this camp, which the World Assembly of Muslim Youth supervises, clothes have been distributed to hundreds of poor families. One of the directors of the organization, Omar Ali Bawab, said: \"We came today to distribute some gifts and clothes for children in order to help them celebrate Eid\".

Due to the long-lasting famine women and children require better medical aid and resources. Many children suffer malnutrition and are threatened by hunger and even death. Countless children die either at the hospitals in the refugee camps or while traveling to seek refuge. In Somalia's capital Mogadishu the Banaadir Hospital is the only hospital for women and children and receives patients from all around the country. Many refugees travel to Mogadishu with their children to the Banaadir hospital seeking medical care and refuge. The Banaadir Hospital was built in 1980s by the Chinese but over the decades of war, it has suffered and is today almost dilapidated. Patients, especially children, receive check-ups and treatment in the hall and the hospital is overcrowded by people waiting to receive medical attention. According to hospital staff children die on a daily basis due to poor sanitary conditions and shortage in medication. Several Muslim nations have set up charities to provide aid for Somalia during the month of Ramadan. Over tens of thousands of children have died due to the famine and the number is expected to rise.

Men, women and children from the Saydika displaced camp took to the streets to protest the lack of basic necessities like proper shelter, food and water. Somalia is at the epicenter of a hunger crisis in the Horn of Africa region which is affecting more than 13 million people. Thousands of Somalis are fleeing to the capital, facing ongoing clashes and civil war, often losing their belongings on the way, in the hope of finding help. Thousands of others have chosen to walk to Kenya or Ethiopia, even if they don't know anyone across these borders. Over decades of conflicts, four million Somalis or 53 percent of the population, have now left the region facing a lack of food and clean water. Aid agencies are only able to get food to one million people. Al Shabaab militants, controls much of the south which makes it hard for food shipments to get into the region where most famine is located. Ongoing battles opposing the Transitional Federal Government forces backed by Africa Union troops against the Islamic militant group al Shabaab, have worsened the conditions for displaced people both inside and outside Mogadishu.

Some 3.7 million Somalis-almost half of the population-are going hungry as a result of the drought that hit over 11.6 million peoples across what local media has dubbed the, \"triangle of death\", a region that straddles Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. \"We have got 14 tons onboard this aircraft which has just landed today, here in Mogadishu. Over the coming days, we will be bringing in an extra of 60 tons of this special, ready to use food, which comes in sachets. It looks a bit like peanut butter; it is very nutritious, full of vitamins and micro nutrients. It treats malnutrition in children\" said the Nairobi spokesperson for the World Food Program, David Orr. According to the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR), there are about 400000 displaced people in the capital, with about 1000 new arrivals each day. It is estimated that 100000 people have arrived in the city over the last two months alone. \"Even if people are able to obtain the food and water being distributed, they often lack even the most basic containers to carry it. Often, they must haul food and water in plastic bags,\" a UNHCR representative has said. The WFP has set up 16 feeding centers across the capital, providing hot meals to new arrivals by using supplies delivered from Kenya and Tanzania.
